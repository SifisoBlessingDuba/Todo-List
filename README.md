!!!!!Welcome to my Todo List!!!!!
This to-do list was coded using VS code IDE, the programming languages used include React, redux, html and css, and forebase. 
The application is a simple todo list application that allows users to add, edit, delete and save their todolist oline in a save and secure way through the internet. 
The application is built with a simple and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate, the navigation has an error where even if the user is logged in it still shows the signIn and signUp buttons and the links still work.
i was able to create user authantication through firebase and also a database store for the infomation to be saved online secure and safe, meaning users can acess their todo lists as soon as they log in even from any device anywhere. 

!!!!!HOW TO USE!!!!!
1. Simply install the following command on your IDE or device "npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit firebase"
2. Then run the following command to start the application "npm start"
3. Open your browser and navigate to "http://localhost:3000"
4. the dashboard page will run and now the website is live on your machine. 
5. you can click on Sign Up if you are a first time user on the site or log in if you have previous details. 
6. Once you are logged in you can add, edit, delete and save your todo list online, which incomparates all the CRUD elements. 

!!!!!WHAT IS MISSING!!!!!
sadly i couldn't add the Redux store, or maybe i did and i just don't know it because this is the first program i did with these laguages, so its not 100% clear as to what is there and what is not. 
i am sure that react and the database are there the only part im not sure of is the redux store but the stite works great as it is. 

!!!!!REFERENCES!!!!!
in this program a lot of research was done and there was a lot of new information that i come across
To create this website I used Youtube to watch a couple of tutorials and courses in the languages
1. https://youtu.be/hZswcXSd5GA?si=ysx8_JdMBcZh6XWk
2. https://youtu.be/5yEG6GhoJBs?si=J2Gqm0xoKj_Kw36X
3. https://youtu.be/9kRgVxULbag?si=Dbmvz9jKNkWCWwCL
I also went through a lot of sites to get a basic understanding of the languages like w3Schools, stackoverflow, GeeksforGeeks as well as react.dev
In the program the was also a use of AI maily chatGPT to help me when i got lost or ran into problems as some of the information the videos was outdated and old, it also help me to generate some of the text in the main dashobard page that you see when running the app. 

Overall thank you and enjoy the application.!!!!!!!
